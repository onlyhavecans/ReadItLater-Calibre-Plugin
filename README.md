# Pocket recipe for Calibre
This is a fork of the original 2011 Calibre ReadItLater plugin.

Pocket is going through a lot of changes since the name change. Please bear with me as changes they have made to their backend may affect the current functionality of the plugin.

If you have suggestions of feature suggestions I will consider them. Please submit them as issues.
