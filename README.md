[Pocket](https://getpocket.com/), previously known as Read It Later, is an application and service for managing a reading list of articles from the Internet. The application allows the user to save an article or web page to the cloud for later reading. The article is then sent to the user's Pocket list (synced to all of their devices) for offline reading. Pocket removes clutter from articles and allows the user to adjust text settings for easier reading [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_%28application%29).

[Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) is a free and open source e-book library management application developed by users of e-books for users of e-books. The programs also allows users to create own e-books and syncing with a variaty of e-book readers (e.g. Kindle, that's how I got the screenshots below) [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calibre_%28software%29).

This is a fork of the original plugin.

I modified the plugin to get an e-book including:

* The latest (more or less as the original version of the plugin)
* your content organized by tags!

Now, you get **The latest** and **The content organized by your tags**:

<table><tr><td><img src="doc/02.png" alt="" style="width: 200px;"/></td><td><img src="doc/03.png" alt="" style="width: 200px;"/></td></tr></table>

.. before:

<img src="doc/01.png" alt="" style="width: 200px;"/>

At the moment you have to define your own tags in the code (variable `self.tags`). It should be changed at some point.

This is a fork of the original 2011 Calibre ReadItLater plugin.

# Settings

```python
    # Settings people change ------------------------------------------------------
    max_articles_per_feed = 20
    minimum_articles      = 1
    mark_as_read_after_dl = False  # Set this to False for testing
    sort_method           = 'newest'  # MUST be either 'oldest' or 'newest'
    title_with_date       = True # if True Pocket+ [Tue, 02 May 2017]
    to_pull               = 'all' #'unread' # or 'unread' What articles to pull? unread only or all?
    compress_news_images  = False # True gives compressed images

    # '' gives "The latest"! e.g. ['','iphone'] to get The latest and articles tagged with `iphone`
    # [''] to get only The latest
    tags = ['', 'iphone']
